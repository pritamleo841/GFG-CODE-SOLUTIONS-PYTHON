        If diff is even, we can flip a step from + to - to reduce the sum exactly by diff/2.
        If diff is odd, we need to take extra steps until diff becomes even.
        This works because flipping a step of value k (from +k to -k) reduces the total sum by 2k. 
        We need an even difference to be able to do this.
